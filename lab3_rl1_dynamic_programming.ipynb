    "in reinforcement learning like *Dynamic Programming*, *Bellman's Principle of Optimality* and *Bellman equations*.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will implement and test the two main dynamic programming algorithms (*Value Iteration* and *Policy Iteration*) in this Python notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can either:\n",
    "- open, edit and execute the notebook in *Google Colab* following this link: https://colab.research.google.com/github/jeremiedecock/polytechnique-csc-52081-ep-2026-students/blob/main/lab3_rl1_dynamic_programming.ipynb ; this is the **recommended** choice as you have nothing to install on your computer\n",
    "- open, edit and execute the notebook in *MyBinder* (if for any reason the Google Colab solution doesn't work): https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jeremiedecock/polytechnique-csc-52081-ep-2026-students/main?filepath=lab3_rl1_dynamic_programming.ipynb\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **File Naming:** Rename your notebook as follows: **`firstname_lastname-03.ipynb`** where `firstname` and `lastname` match your email address. *Example: `jesse_read-03.ipynb`*\n",
    "2. **Clear Output Cells:** To reduce file size (**must be under 500 KB**), clear all output cells before submitting. This includes rendered images, videos, plots, and dataframes...\n",
    "   - **JupyterLab:**\n",
    "     - Click **\"Kernel\" → \"Restart Kernel and Clear Outputs of All Cells...\"**\n",
    "     - Then go to **\"File\" → \"Save Notebook As...\"**\n",
    "   - **Google Colab:**\n",
    "     - Click **\"Edit\" → \"Clear all outputs\"**\n",
    "     - Then go to **\"File\" → \"Download\" → \"Download.ipynb\"**\n",
    "   - **VSCode:**\n",
    "     - Click **\"Clear All Outputs\"**\n",
    "     - Then **save your file**\n",
    "3. **Upload Your File:** Only **`.ipynb`** files are accepted.\n",
