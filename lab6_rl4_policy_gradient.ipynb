    "The REINFORCE algorithm, introduced by Williams in 1992, is a Monte Carlo policy gradient method. It updates the policy in the direction that maximizes rewards, using full-episode returns as an unbiased estimate of the gradient.

This algorithm is simple yet powerful, and it's particularly effective in environments where the policy gradient is noisy or the dynamics are complex.\n",

    "### Exercise 2: REINFORCE with Baseline\n",
    "\n",
    "In the basic REINFORCE algorithm, the policy parameters are updated in proportion to the product of the gradient of the policy log-probability and the cumulative reward (return) from a state-action pair. However, this approach can lead to high variance in policy updates, making learning slower.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, a *baseline* is introduced to reduce this variance. It is a value subtracted from the cumulative reward when calculating the policy gradient. The key property of the baseline is that it does not affect the expected value of the gradient estimate, which means it doesn't bias the learning process but reduces the variance of the updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The baseline can be thought of as a reference point or an \"average\" expectation of reward. By comparing the actual rewards to this baseline, we can determine whether the outcomes of certain actions are better or worse than this \"average\" performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common choice for the baseline is the value function of the current policy, $\\hat{V}_{\\boldsymbol{\\omega}}$. By using the value function as a baseline, the algorithm adjusts the policy towards actions that perform better than the average.\n",
    "\n",
    "To incorporate the baseline into REINFORCE, you modify the update rule. Instead of using the total return $G$​ directly, you subtract the baseline value $\\hat{V}_{\\boldsymbol{\\omega}}$ from $G$​ in the policy gradient estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "By centering the rewards around a baseline, the variance of the policy gradient estimates is reduced. This leads to more stable and efficient learning, as the updates are less noisy and more focused on improving relative to the average performance."
