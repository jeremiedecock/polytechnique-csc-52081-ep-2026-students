    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous lab, we dealt with reinforcement learning in discrete state and action spaces.\n",
    "To do so, we used methods based on action-value function and especially $Q$-function estimation.\n",
    "The $Q$-function was stored in a table and updated with on- or off- policy algorithms (namely SARSA and $Q$-Learning).\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet, these methods do not scale to large state spaces and especially not to the case of continuous state spaces.\n",
    "To address these issues one can either extend the value-based methods making use of the value-function approximation or directly search in policy spaces.\n",
    "In this lab, we will explore both solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part of this lab presents the problem to solve: the CartPole environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second part, we will apply value-function approximation methods (namely DQN) to solve the CartPole problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for previous labs, you can either:\n",
